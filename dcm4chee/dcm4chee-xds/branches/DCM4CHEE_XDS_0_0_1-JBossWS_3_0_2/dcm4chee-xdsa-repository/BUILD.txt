BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE XDS.a REPOSITORY:
========================================================

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running DCM4CHEE
you also have to download and install Maven 2.0.7 from
http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building the XDS Repository.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

$ cd dcm4chee-xdsa-repository
$ mvn install

(will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
before building MBean and WEB components of the XDS.a Repository.)

Afterwards

$ cd dcm4chee-xdsa-repository-dist
$ mvn assembly:assembly

will assembly the binary distribution package dcm4chee-xdsa-repository-1.0.zip,
including the jar and war archive built before along with MBean configuration files 
and third-party libraries. (dcm4che-core-2.0.12.jar)
