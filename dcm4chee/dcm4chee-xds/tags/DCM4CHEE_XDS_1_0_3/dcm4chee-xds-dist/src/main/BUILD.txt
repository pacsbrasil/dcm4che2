BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE XDS Modules:
========================================================

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running DCM4CHEE
you also have to download and install Maven 2.0.9 from
http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building the XDS Repository.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

dcm4chee-xds also make use of

- dcm4chee-docstore : Generic Document Storage (used by RID - Retrieve Information for Display) 

which sources are not included by dcm4chee-xds-1.0.3-src.zip, but provided in a
separate ZIP archive: dcm4chee-docstore-1.0.3-src.zip at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che.

$ cd dcm4chee-docstore-1.0.3
$ mvn install

dcm4chee-xds also make use of

- dcm4chee-xds-infoset : XDS Infoset classes (XDS Query for Consumer and Document Lifecycle)

which sources are not included by dcm4chee-xds-1.0.3-src.zip, but provided in a
separate ZIP archive: dcm4chee-xds-infoset-1.0.3-src.zip at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che. 

$ cd dcm4chee-xds-infoset-1.0.3
$ mvn install

Build dcm4chee-xds modules:

$ cd dcm4chee-xds
$ mvn install

(will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
before building MBean and WEB components of the XDS.a Repository.)

Afterwards

$ cd dcm4chee-xds-dist
$ mvn assembly:assembly

will assembly the binary distribution package dcm4chee-xds-1.0.3.zip,
including the jar and war and sar along with MBean configuration files 
and third-party libraries. (dcm4che-core-2.0.21.jar)
