BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR Store2Dcm Service:
========================================================

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running DCM4CHEE
you also have to download and install Maven 2.0.7 from
http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building the XDS Repository.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

$ cd dcm4chee-xds-store2dcm
$ mvn install

(will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
before building JBoss Service (JMX) components in a sar package.)
The install also tries also an integration test with a local Store (and Storage Commit) SCP.
Therefore the test tries a DICOM Echo to AET DCM4CHEE (localhost:11112) and enable the test on success response.
The StgCmtSCU configuration would be: AET=DOC_SEND_TEST on port 11114!  
Attention: The build will fail for test 'SendDocumentAndStgCmt' if a Store SCP is available but the DOC_SEND_TEST is not configured accordingly!


Build the distribution:

$ cd dcm4chee-xds-store2dcm-dist
$ mvn assembly:assembly

will assembly the binary distribution package dcm4chee-xds-store2dcm-2.13.0.zip,
including the sar archive built before along with third-party libraries. 
(dcm4che-core-2.0.12.jar and dcm4che-net-2.0.12.jar)
