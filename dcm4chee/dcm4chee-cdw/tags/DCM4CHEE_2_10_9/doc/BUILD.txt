Build Instructions for DICOM CD Writer dcm4chee-cdw:
=============================================

In order to build dcm4chee-cdw you have to download and install:
- Ant 1.6.x (from http://ant.apache.org)
- JUnit 3.8.x (from http://junit.org)
- JBoss 3.2.6 (from http://jboss.org)
- FOP 0.20.5 (from http://xml.apache.org/fop/)

Create an environment variable pointing to the Ant home directory (ANT_HOME)
and add the $ANT_HOME/bin directory to your PATH.

Copy junit.jar from the JUnit package into $ANT_HOME/lib/.

You also need a distribution of dcm4che DICOM core library - download the
binary disrtribution or build dcm4che from the source - before
you can build dcm4chee-cdw.

At first time, connecting to the project CVS repository, you have to login by

>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dcm4che.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dcm4che login
CVS password:<enter>

Download the source of the dcm4che core library by

>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dcm4che.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dcm4che
  checkout dcm4che14 

and build the library jar, by running

>ant jar

with the dcm4che14 distribution directory as working directory.

The source of the dcm4chee-cdw package is available in module dcm4jboss-cdw
in the dcm4che project CVS repository:

>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dcm4che.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dcm4che
  checkout dcm4jboss-cdw

The default build script (build.xml) assumes following locations of
components required for building dcm4chee-cdw:

<!-- Override with your dcm4che dist location -->
<property name="dcm4che.home" value="../dcm4che14/build/dcm4che-1.1.4"/>

<!-- Override with your JBoss/Web server bundle dist location -->
<property name="jboss.home" value="${user.home}/jboss-3.2.6"/>		

<!-- Override with your FOP dist location -->
<property name="fop.home" value="${user.home}/fop-0.20.5"/>

Instead of modifying the build script directly, you may adjust these values
to your build environment by renaming file build.properties.default to
build.properties and modify the values in it.

After that, invoking

>ant dist

with the dcm4chee-cdw distribution directory as working directory builds:

target/dcm4chee-cdw-VERSION.zip:
Binary distribution without needed JBoss Components

target/dcm4chee-cdw-standalone-VERSION.zip:
Binary distribution included JBoss Application Server

target/dcm4chee-cdw-src-VERSION.zip:
Source distribution.
