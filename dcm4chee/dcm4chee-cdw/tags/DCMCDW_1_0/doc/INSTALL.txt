Install Instructions for DICOM CD Writer dcmcdw:
===============================================

System Requirements:

    CPU: 400 MHz
    RAM: 128 MB (256 MB recommended)
    Hard Disk Space: > 2 x Media capacity + 50MB
    ATAPI CD/DVD Recorder supported by cdrtool/cdrecord
    OS: any operating system with a JVM 
    JDK 1.4.2+


Prerequisites:

  + JDK 1.4.2+ (JRE is not sufficient!), free available at
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/. (dcmcdw should also run with JDK 1.5,
    but it was mainly tested with JDK 1.4.2_06).
    It is recommended to define an environment variable JAVA_HOME pointing
    to the JDK directory and to append $JAVA_HOME/bin - or %JAVA_HOME%\bin -
    to your PATH.
    
  + JBoss Application Server 3.2.6+, free available at http://www.jboss.org.
  
  + Joerg Schilling's cdrtools including mkisofs and cdrecord
    [http://freshmeat.net/projects/cdrecord]. Precompiled binaries for Windows,
    including the necessary cygwin.dll are (e.g) available at
    http://www.geoshock.com/cdrtools.
    If cdrecord fails to detect the CD drive on Windows, try Nero ASPI Library
    (wnaspi32.dll) by Ahead Software AG (free download from nero.com) instead
    your system default ASPI driver.
    On Unix/Linux, you have to take care, that the user as which JBoss is
    running has the permission to execute cdrecord.
    It is also recommended to add the directory containing mkisofs[.exe] and
    cdrecord[.exe] to your PATH.
    
  + For Label printing on Windows Printer without Postscript support
    dcmcdw needs (e.g.) Acrobat Reader (free download from adobe.com).
    

Installation:

 1. Unzip the ZIP archive into the server sub-directory of your JBoss
    installation
    
 2. Open a console and change the working directory to dcmcdw/bin of
    the extracted file set and run:
    
    [Windows]    install
    [Unix/Linux] ./install.sh
    
    to copy necessary files from the JBoss installation into this file set.
    
 4. Change the working directory to the bin directory of the JBoss
    installation and start the JBoss Application Server with dcmcdw
    server configuration:
    
    [Windows]    run -c dcmcdw
    [Unix/Linux] ./run.sh -c dcmcdw
    
    Check the console output, if any ERROR log message occurs during start up.
    After the message 

    23:44:46,857 INFO  [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [3.2.6 (build: CVSTag=JBoss_3_2_6 date=200410140106)] Started in 1m:41s:180ms
    
    the start up is completed.
    
 5. Open the JBoss Administration Console http://localhost:8080/jmx-console with
    any Web Browser. Scroll down to section "tiani.dcmcdw" and follow the link
    of the section title to only show entires for dcmcdw specific services:
 
    * name=CDRecord,service=MediaWriter
    * name=CDRecord,service=Queue
    * name=MakeIsoImage,service=Queue
    * name=MediaComposer,service=Queue
    * name=NeroCmd,service=MediaWriter
    * name=NeroCmd,service=Queue
    * service=DcmServer
    * service=LabelPrint
    * service=MakeIsoImage
    * service=MediaComposer
    * service=MediaCreationMgtSCP
    * service=SpoolDir
    * service=SpoolDirScheduler
    * service=StoreSCP
 
 6. Follow the link to the Media Writer Service for usage of cdrecord
    (->"name=CDRecord,service=MediaWriter") and adjust the value of attribute:
    
    Device="0,0,0"
    
    to the SCSI address (Syntax: scsibus,target,lun) of the CD/DVD-Recorder on
    your system. If cdrecord is not on your PATH you have also configure its
    absolute path as value of attribute
    
    Executable="cdrecord"
    
    . - In that case you may also have to configure an absolute path for
    invoking mkisofs by the MakeIsoImage service (->"service=MakeIsoImage").
    
    Test if the CDRecord service can control your CD Drive by invoking operation
    
    eject()
    
    from its configuration page.
    
 7. For usage of Acrobat Reader as external print utility for label print on
    Windows Printer you have to adjust the command path in batch file
    
    dcmcdw/bin/acroread.bat
    
    and set Label Print Service (->"service=LabelPrint") attribute 
    
    UseExternalPrintUtility=true.
    
    Label creation and printing is deactivated by default configuration.
    To activate it, you have to modify attribute
    
    LableFileFormat=NO
    
    of the Media Composer Service (->"service=MediaComposer") and set the
    CDRecord service attribute
    
    PrintLabel=true
    
    .
    
     

    
Test dcmcdw using dcmsnd.jar and mcmscu.jar command line utilities:

 1. Open a (second) console and change the working directory to dcmcdw/bin of
    the extracted file set.
    
 2. Run
    
    java -jar dcmsnd.jar dicom://CDRECORD@localhost:10104 FILE|DIRECTORY...
    
    to send DICOM objects - specified by FILE or DIRECTORY - to the server,
    using DICOM Storage Services.
    
 3. Run      
 
    java -jar mcmscu.jar -ca --create=IncludeNonDICOMObjects:FOR_PHYSICIAN \
                         dicom://CDRECORD@localhost:10104 FILE|DIRECTORY...
    
    to create a Media Creation Request refering the transmitted DICOM objects 
    and requesting the generation of web content
    (IncludeNonDICOMObjects:FOR_PHYSICIAN), and immediately inititate (-a)
    the Media Creation at the server.
    
    In the server console you should see logging messages documenting the
    process of the Media Creation:
    
    01:39:45,167 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Start Composing media for MCRQ
    01:40:20,361 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Start Creating HTML content for MCRQ
    01:40:29,364 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Finished Creating HTML content for MCRQ
    01:40:31,092 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Finished Composing media for MCRQ
    01:40:31,093 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Schedule Creating ISO image for MCRQ
    01:40:31,204 INFO  [MakeIsoImageService] Start Creating ISO 9660 image for MCRQ
    01:40:34,885 INFO  [MakeIsoImageService] Schedule Creating Media for MCRQ
    01:40:34,952 INFO  [CDRecordService] Start Creating Media for MCRQ
    01:40:52,067 INFO  [CDRecordService] Burning MCRQ
    01:41:29,777 INFO  [CDRecordService] Burned MCRQ
    01:41:39,790 INFO  [CDRecordService] Finished Creating Media for MCRQ

 4. Run

    java -jar mcmscu.jar --help
    
    and look into configuration file mcmscu.cfg for other available options.
    

How to modify the layout of generated INDEX.HTM, Web Content and/or Media Label?    
 
    dcmcdw creates INDEX.HTM, HTML pages and Media Label by applying
    XSL stylesheets, located at dcmcdw/conf/xsl/, to a XMLized version
    of the DICOM directory (DICOMDIR) content. So you can change the layout
    by modifying the XSL stylesheets.
    
    Setting Media Composer Service (->"service=MediaComposer") attribute
    
    LogXml=true
    
    causes dcmcdw to dump the DICOMDIR xml version into
        
    dcmcdw/log/dicomdir.xml .
    
    Then the XSLT transformation can be applied manually:
    
    To generate INDEX.HTM in the disk root directory (assuming 
    dcmcdw/bin as working directory) run:
    
    [Windows]    xalan -IN ..\log\dicomdir.xml -XSL ..\conf\xsl\index.xsl 
                    -OUT INDEX.HTM
    [Unix/Linux] ./xalan.sh -IN ../log/dicomdir.xml -XSL ../conf/xsl/index.xsl 
                    -OUT INDEX.HTM
    
    To generate the the Web Presentation run:
    
    [Windows]    xalan -IN ..\log\dicomdir.xml -XSL ..\conf\xsl\web.xsl 
                    -OUT INDEX.HTM
    [Unix/Linux] ./xalan.sh -IN ../log/dicomdir.xml -XSL ../conf/xsl/web.xsl 
                    -OUT INDEX.HTM
                    
    To generate the Disk Label, using Apaches FOP:
    
    [Windows]    fop -xml ../log/dicomdir.xml -xsl ../conf/xsl/label.xsl
                    -pdf label.pdf
    [Unix/Linux] ./fop.sh -xml ../log/dicomdir.xml -xsl ../conf/xsl/label.xsl
                    -pdf label.pdf


Hopefully, these briefly instructions are sufficent to start exploring
the abilities of dcm4che/dcmcdw yourself. - Contributions to the
documention of dcmcdw are highly appreciated.

Have Fun,
