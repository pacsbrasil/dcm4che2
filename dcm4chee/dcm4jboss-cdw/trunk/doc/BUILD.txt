BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE MEDIA CREATOR:
=============================================

The source code of the dcm4chee Media Creator is included in sub-directory
dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw of the source package dcm4chee-2.13.0-src.zip of
the dcm4chee Archive application, available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che .
 
In order to build dcm4chee Media Creator application you also have to download
and install:

- Ant 1.7.0 [http://ant.apache.org]

- JBoss Application Server 4.2.1.GA [http://labs.jboss.com/jbossas/downloads]

- Apache FOP 0.20.5 [http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/]

Create an environment variable pointing to the Ant home directory (ANT_HOME)
and add the $ANT_HOME/bin directory to your PATH.

The build script (dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw/build.xml) assumes following
locations of JBoss and Apache FOP:

jboss.home=${user.home}/jboss-4.2.1.GA
fop.home=${user.home}/fop-0.20.5

Instead of modifying the build scripts directly, you may adjust these values
to your build environment by renaming file 

dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw/build.properties.default
to
dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw/build.properties

and adjust these values there.

Change the working directory:
>cd dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw

and invoke:
>ant dist

to build

target/dcm4chee-cdw-<version>.zip
.
