INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE MEDIA CREATOR:
===============================================

Minimum System Requirements
JDK 5 or higher.
512 MB RAM
2(10) GB hard disk space for CD(DVD) media creation   
400 MHz CPU

dcm4chee-cdw relies on Joerg Schilling's cdrtools
[http://freshmeat.net/projects/cdrecord], in particular on mkisofs to
generate iso9660 filesystems, and on cdrecord to write CD/DVD media on a
CD/DVD-Recorder. Precompiled binaries for Windows, including the necessary
cygwin.dll are (e.g) available at http://www.student.tugraz.at/thomas.plank/.
If cdrecord fails to detect the CD drive on Windows, try Nero ASPI Library
(wnaspi32.dll) by Ahead Software AG (free download from nero.com) instead your
system default ASPI driver.
On Unix/Linux, you have to take care, that the user as which JBoss is running
has the permission to execute cdrecord.
It is also recommended to add the directory containing mkisofs[.exe] and
cdrecord[.exe] to your PATH.
On Windows, alternatively to cdrecord, commandline utility nerocmd.exe from
commercial Nero Burning ROM software by Nero AG can be used for controlling
the CD/DVD recorder.

For Label printing on Windows Printer without Postscript support
dcm4chee-cdw needs Acrobat Reader (free download from adobe.com).

For testing media creation by dcm4chee-cdw, you may use command line utility
mcmscu.jar of the dcm4che14 package available at Sourceforge
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che), which implements a DICOM Media
Creation Management SCU, to send Media Creation requests to the DICOM
Creation Management SCP of dcm4chee-cdw.
 
For image decompression (only needed for web content generation with compressed
DICOM images), dcm4chee-cdw 2.17.0 utilize Sun's Java Advanced Imaging Image
I/O Tools 1.2. The binary distribution packages of dcm4chee-cdw 2.17.0 already
includes necessary JARs and native libraries for Windows and Linux i586. For
Linux-amd64 or Solaris, you have to download the SW package from Sun
[https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html] yourself and replace the
Linux version of libclib_jiio.so in dcm4chee-cdw-2.17.0/bin/native from the
JAI Image IO package for Linux-amd64 or Solaris.

Installation Procedure:

1. Extract the binary distribution package of dcm4chee-cdw. Avoid using a
   directory that has a name that contains spaces as installation directory.

2. Download the binary distribution package of JBoss Application Server 4.2.3.GA
   from http://labs.jboss.com/jbossas/downloads and extract it into a different
   directory.

3. Move to the dcm4chee-cdw-2.17.0/bin directory and execute the
   install_jboss.bat or install_jboss.sh script, as appropriate for your
   operating system, with the path of your JBoss AS installation directory as
   parameter.

4. Set environment variable JAVA_HOME to JDK location.

5. Adjust maximum allocation of heap memory:

   [Windows]: dcm4chee-cdw-2.17.0/bin/run.bat:
   rem Sun JVM memory allocation pool parameters. Modify as appropriate.
   set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms128m -Xmx512m

   [Linux/Unix]: dcm4chee-cdw-2.17.0/bin/run.conf
   # Specify options to pass to the Java VM.
   if [ "x$JAVA_OPTS" = "x" ]; then
     JAVA_OPTS="-Xms128m -Xmx512m ..
   fi

   according available RAM and memory requirements of other processes on this
   node. E.g.: if only 512 MB RAM are available, you should decrease the default
   value -Xmx512m to (e.g.) -Xmx300.

6. To test your installation, move to the dcm4chee-cdw-2.17.0/bin directory
   and execute the run.bat or run.sh script, as appropriate for your operating
   system. To enable remote access to jboss services, in particular to the
   JMX console (http://HOST:8080/jmx-console) and the JBoss Web console
   (http://HOST:8080/web-console), you have to invoke the start script with
   parameter '-b 0.0.0.0'! Your output should look like the following and
   contain no error or exception messages:

7. Open the JBoss Administration Console http://localhost:8080/jmx-console with
   any Web Browser. Scroll down to section "dcm4chee.cdw" and follow the link
   of the section title to only show entires for dcm4chee-cdw specific services:
 
    * name=CDRecord,service=MediaWriter
    * name=CDRecord,service=Queue
    * name=MakeIsoImage,service=Queue
    * name=MediaComposer,service=Queue
    * name=NeroCmd,service=MediaWriter
    * name=NeroCmd,service=Queue
    * service=DcmServer
    * service=LabelPrint
    * service=MakeIsoImage
    * service=MediaComposer
    * service=MediaCreationMgtSCP
    * service=SpoolDir
    * service=SpoolDirScheduler
    * service=StoreSCP
 
8.  Follow the link to the Media Writer Service for usage of cdrecord
    (->"name=CDRecord,service=MediaWriter") and adjust the value of attribute:
    
    Device="0,0,0"
    
    to the SCSI address (Syntax: scsibus,target,lun) of the CD/DVD-Recorder on
    your system. If cdrecord is not on your PATH you have also configure its
    absolute path as value of attribute
    
    Executable="cdrecord"
    
    . - In that case you may also have to configure an absolute path for
    invoking mkisofs by the MakeIsoImage service (->"service=MakeIsoImage").
    
    Test if the CDRecord service can control your CD Drive by invoking operation
    
    eject()
    
    from its configuration page.
    
9.  For usage of Acrobat Reader as external print utility for label print on
    Windows Printer you have to adjust the command path in batch file
    
    dcm4chee-cdw-xxx/bin/acroread.bat
    
    and set Label Print Service (->"service=LabelPrint") attribute 
    
    UseExternalPrintUtility=true.
    
    Label creation and printing is deactivated by default configuration.
    To activate it, you have to modify attribute
    
    LableFileFormat=NO
    
    of the Media Composer Service (->"service=MediaComposer") and set the
    CDRecord service attribute
    
    PrintLabel=true
    

10. Test dcm4chee-cdw using dcmsnd.jar and mcmscu.jar command line utilities of
    the dcm4che14 package available at
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che :

 a. Run
    
    java -jar dcm4che-1.4.28/bin/dcmsnd.jar dicom://CDRECORD@localhost:10104 \
        FILE|DIRECTORY...
    
    to send DICOM objects - specified by FILE or DIRECTORY - to the server,
    using DICOM Storage Services.
    
 b. Run      
 
    java -jar dcm4che-1.4.28/bin/mcmscu.jar -ca \
       --create=IncludeNonDICOMObjects:FOR_PHYSICIAN \
       dicom://CDRECORD@localhost:10104 FILE|DIRECTORY...
    
    to create a Media Creation Request refering the transmitted DICOM objects 
    and requesting the generation of web content
    (IncludeNonDICOMObjects:FOR_PHYSICIAN), and immediately inititate (-a)
    the Media Creation at the server.
    
    In the server console you should see logging messages documenting the
    process of the Media Creation:
    
    01:39:45,167 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Start Composing media for MCRQ
    01:40:20,361 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Start Creating HTML content for MCRQ
    01:40:29,364 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Finished Creating HTML content for MCRQ
    01:40:31,092 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Finished Composing media for MCRQ
    01:40:31,093 INFO  [MediaComposerService] Schedule Creating ISO image for MCRQ
    01:40:31,204 INFO  [MakeIsoImageService] Start Creating ISO 9660 image for MCRQ
    01:40:34,885 INFO  [MakeIsoImageService] Schedule Creating Media for MCRQ
    01:40:34,952 INFO  [CDRecordService] Start Creating Media for MCRQ
    01:40:52,067 INFO  [CDRecordService] Burning MCRQ
    01:41:29,777 INFO  [CDRecordService] Burned MCRQ
    01:41:39,790 INFO  [CDRecordService] Finished Creating Media for MCRQ

 c. Run

    java -jar mcmscu.jar --help
    
    and look into configuration file mcmscu.cfg for other available options.

11. If that works, you may stop the Media Creation Server by Ctrl+C in the
    console you have started it, and 
    [Windows]: install it as Windows service executing install_service.bat
    or 
    [Redhat Linux]: copy the init script jboss_init_redhat.sh to /etc/init.d/
    and adjust it according your installation location of the archive and the
    JDK and under which user the archive application shall run.  


MODIFY THE LAYOUT OF GENERATED INDEX.HTM, WEB CONTENT AND/OR MEDIA LABEL:
=========================================================================
    dcm4chee-cdw creates INDEX.HTM, HTML pages and Media Label by applying
    XSL stylesheets, located at default/conf/dcm4chee-cdw/, to a XMLized version
    of the DICOM directory (DICOMDIR) content. So you can change the layout
    by modifying the XSL stylesheets.
    
    Setting Media Composer Service (->"service=MediaComposer") attribute
    
    LogXml=true
    
    causes dcm4chee-cdw to dump the DICOMDIR xml version into
        
    dcm4chee-cdw-2.x/default/log/dicomdir.xml .
    
    Then the XSLT transformation can be applied manually:
    
    To generate INDEX.HTM in the disk root directory (assuming 
    dcm4chee-cdw-2.x/bin as working directory) run:
    
    [Windows]    xalan -IN ..\server\default\log\dicomdir.xml ^
                       -XSL ..\server\default\conf\dcm4chee-cdw\index.xsl ^
                       -OUT INDEX.HTM
    [Unix/Linux] ./xalan.sh -IN ../server/default/log/dicomdir.xml \
                       -XSL ../server/default/conf/dcm4chee-cdw/index.xsl \
                       -OUT INDEX.HTM
    
    To generate the the Web Presentation run:
    
    [Windows]    xalan -IN ..\server\default\log\dicomdir.xml ^
                       -XSL ..\server\default\conf\dcm4chee-cdw\web.xsl ^
                       -OUT INDEX.HTM
    [Unix/Linux] ./xalan.sh -IN ../server/default/log/dicomdir.xml \
                       -XSL ../server/default/conf/dcm4chee-cdw/web.xsl \
                       -OUT INDEX.HTM
                    
    To generate the Disk Label, using Apaches FOP:
    
    [Windows]    fop -xml ..\server\default\log\dicomdir.xml ^
                     -xsl ..\server\default\conf\dcm4chee-cdw\label.xsl ^
                     -pdf label.pdf
    [Unix/Linux] ./fop.sh -xml ../server/default/log/dicomdir.xml \
                     -xsl ../server/default/conf/dcm4chee-cdw/label.xsl \
                     -pdf label.pdf
