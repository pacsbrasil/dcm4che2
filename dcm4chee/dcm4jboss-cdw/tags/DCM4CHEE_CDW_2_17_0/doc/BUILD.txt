BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE MEDIA CREATOR (DCM4CHEE-CDW):
===========================================================

In order to build dcm4chee Media Creator application you also have to download
and install:

- Ant 1.7.0 [http://ant.apache.org]

- JBoss Application Server 4.2.3.GA [http://labs.jboss.com/jbossas/downloads]

- Apache FOP 0.95 [http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/]

dcm4chee-cdw-2.17.0 also relies on

- dcm4che-1.4.29 : dcm4che DICOM Library

which binary and source distribution package is also available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che. The binary package is sufficient to
build dcm4chee-cdw. If you download the source package, you have to build
all components of dcm4che-1.4.28 (ant release) before building dcm4chee-cdw.

Create an environment variable pointing to the Ant home directory (ANT_HOME)
and add the $ANT_HOME/bin directory to your PATH.

The build script (dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw/build.xml) assumes following
locations of dcm4che-1.4.28, JBoss and Apache FOP:

dcm4che14.home=${user.home}/dcm4che14/build/dcm4che-1.4.19
jboss.home=${user.home}/jboss-4.2.3.GA
fop.home=${user.home}/fop-0.20.5

Instead of modifying the build scripts directly, you may adjust these values
to your build environment by renaming file 

dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw/build.properties.default
to
dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw/build.properties

and adjust these values there.

Change the working directory:
>cd dcm4jboss-all/dcm4jboss-cdw

and invoke:
>ant dist

to build

target/dcm4chee-cdw-<version>.zip
.
