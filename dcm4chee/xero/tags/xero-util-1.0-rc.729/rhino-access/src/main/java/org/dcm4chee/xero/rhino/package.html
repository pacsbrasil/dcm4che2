<h1>Rhino Extensions Package</h1>
<p>The Rhino extensions package defines some wrapping for Rhino objects to allow treating them as a Map 
or Array object instead of as Rhino objects.  This allows use of the objects within applications such
as Stringtemplate rendering that only knows how to access image type objects.</p>

<h2>Sugar Wrap Objects</h2>
<p>If the sugar-wrap factory is in use, then the base, underlying Java object will be available in the 
map that represents the Java object.  This allows passing native Java objects both in and out of 
JavaScript unchanged, and to be used as a native JavaScript object when inside JavaScript.<p>

<h2>Meta-Data Lazy Factory</h2>
<p>JavaScript objects can be declared in a MapWithDefaults object by using a JavaScriptMapFactory - this
takes existing objects and adds them to the map, from the default or a configured JavaScript object.
If, additionally, the constructor name is provided, if the object doesn't exist, a new object of the
right type will be created in the JavaScript world.</p>
