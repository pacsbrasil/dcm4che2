  <h1>Xero Server and Client Model</h1>
  <p>The Xero model contains objects that are used by the view and controller to define the Xero interface data.  The
  model objects additionally contain some amount of logic that is model dependent and computes model related values.
  One could argue that this is properly controller logic, but this logic is only included when it is tightly tied
  to the model data itself rather than being tied to controller logic.</p>
  
  <h2>Duplication of Client/Server Model Classes</h2>
  <p>The client model classes are written in JavaScript, while the server components are in Java.  This allows each
  component to run in an appropriate environment for that component.  Unfortunately, it does result in some duplication
  of effort, and could result in some bugs that are only seen in pages rendered in one environment and not the other.  
  One option that can be considered is to run the JavaScript server side, allowing the server to maintain the 
  conversational model and other data specific to the window.  This might result in slightly slower server side 
  rendering, but seems like it would be a good choice for data re-use, and will be an option considered going forward.</p>
  
  <h2>Serving Model/View/Controller JavaScript</h2>
  <p>The way that the server provides the client JavaScript is to use a StringTemplateFilter and to make the 
  JavaScript created be done by instantiating templates.  The advantage of doing it this way is that additional
  templates can be created for additional components such as each part of the MVC triad, and that additional components
  can be plugged in by defining the correct meta-data in files associated with the templates. As well, the templates
  can also be combined into a single overall JavaScript file.  This also allows alternative implementations to add
  or remove model files, or define new, customized files for specific additions or extensions to Xero.</p>
  
  <h2>XML Data</h2>
  <p>XML Data is used quite heavily in Xero, with both configuration data and Study data being represented by XML. 
  The base XML design is that each XML element corresponds to an object, and that attributes on the object
  correspond to non-nested attributes in the object, while child elements correspond to lists of child elements
  in the parent object.  Thus, a study contains a list of series, (called "series"), and has an attribute PatientName.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Initialization of Static (or semi-static) Data</h3>
  <p>The intialization of static or semi-static data such as layout and column information needs to occur on both
  the client and server sides.  Currently the data is entirely replicated on each side, but the intent is to fix
  this and to use some sort of model plugin object to allow defining repeated elements and some way to manage
  nested layout/object creation.  <b>TODO</b> figure out how to manage this - thoughts are to use XML representations
  or to use a generated JavaScript based on elements in the model.</p>
  
  <h2>Server Side Context</h2>
  <p>The server side context uses a MapWithDefaults to compute static model and data components, and then can use
  factories to compute dynamic data or to read data from other places such as from the user session context.  That
  makes it easy to add additional server side on-demand components just be registering them in the metadata.</p>
  
  <h2>Adding Client Side Model Components</h2>
  <b>TODO - once the plugin model is better defined.</b>
  
  <h2>Adding Server Side Model Components</h2>
  <p>Server side model components can be added just by declaring them in the model.* context of the metadata, for example:
  <pre>
model.query=${factory:org.dcm4chee.xero.controller.RequestValidator}
</pre>
   defines the query object as a request validator.  In this case, it is a factory request, so a new instance is made
   the first time the object is accessed.</p>
