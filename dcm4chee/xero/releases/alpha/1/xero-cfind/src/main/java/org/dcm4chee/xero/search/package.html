<h1>Xero Search Package</h1>

<p>The general purpose of the Xero Search package is to provide a set of classes, markup and
ejb's that provide generic search functionality.  This is complemented by the Xero Search Facelets
package that provides HTML display and interaction with the given functionality.
The intended functionality includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrary columns defined as late as run time.</li>
<li>Typed data in columns, including enumerated values, automatically internationalized.</li>
<li>Differentiation between searchable columns and displayable columns.</li>
<li>User preference for ordering of columns and inclusion/exclusion of display of columns.</li>
<li>Separation of validation of search criteria type of search and inclusion into the
generic functionality for the type being searched.</li>
<li>Ability to provide/modify the available columns after searching has been initiated
based on the actual data returned.</li>
</ol>

<p>The general design of this is to separate the search organization and logic into various
pieces that can be added in later.  One part includes the information about the columns
that can be displayed, another about the search conditions, another about the types and
enumerated values etc.</p>
