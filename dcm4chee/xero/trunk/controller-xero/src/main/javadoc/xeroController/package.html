<h1>XeroController</h1>
<p>
The XeroController class defines the entire client side controller.  One instance of this class exists for the client
and all GUI events are first handled by it.  
</p>
<p>
The class is coded across many files in the package.  Each file controls a specific area of the GUI.  For example, 
findController deals with the Xero search/list page.  Typically each file adds methods and properties to the XeroContoller 
prototype.
</p>
<p>
The controller is logically divided in two:  
<ul>
<li>a (traditional) controller that updates the model and then causes the view to update</li>
<li>a dynamic controller that directly updates the view (for operations such as pan)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The general logic for the traditional controller is as such:
<ul>
<li>A GUI event (e.g. mouse click, mouse move, etc.) occurs and the appropriate handler method in the controller is invoked.</li>
<li>The model is instructed to update</li>
<li>The client side string template engine is used to generate the updated html for the view.   In some cases, the controller waits 
for the model to be fully update-to-date (see XeroController.prototype.waitUpdate) before retrieving the html.  For example,
the controller may wait for an image to load before generating the html.</li>
<li>The live html is replaced with that generated by StringTemplate (see DOMUtils.updateHtml)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The traditional controller code can be found in this (i.e. xeroController) package while the xeroController.dynamic package contains 
the code for the dymanic controller.
</p>
<p>
DOMUtils is a static set of methods primarily used for updating the live html/DOM with a piece of html text.  A diff of
the live DOM with the replacement html is performed thus performing a more logical update of the live DOM instead of a
simple replace of the html.
</p>
<p>
Some methods in DOMUtils are useful on their own.  For example, there is a method to get the id of an element should
the id property of an element DOM object not be defined.  There is also a method that obtains the child element of a
node using a supplied id.
