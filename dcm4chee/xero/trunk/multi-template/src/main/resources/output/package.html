<h1>Output Multi-Templates</h1>
<p>The output package contains the templates for displaying various types of output information, including dates, 
time, integers, strings and tables of the same.</p>

<h2>Default Built-in Templates</h2>
<h3>eval</h3>
Replaces the body with the evaluation of v, or if that evaluates to null, with the child of the eval.

<h3>literal</h3>
Defines literal data for use by various phases.

<h3>macro</h3>
An initial load time expansion - calls the code in the context of the child element, so that expansions of
meta-data and things like that get correctly handled if they are defined differently in different places.
Causes any parent using the object to include the nested definition as appropriate.

<h3>template</h3>
An expansion template that is NOT dependent on meta context it is used in except for what child templates get called.

<h3>component</h3>
An expansion almost exactly like template except that it gets called with a new variable context - gets WILL read from the
parent, but any sets are temporary until the end of the component instance.  Is slightly slower than template,
so both are provided.

<h3>if</h3>
A conditional test that evaluates it's body only if the test condition is true.

<h3>for</h3>
A conditional test that evaluates it's body for each element of the provided object/range.

<h3>choose/when/otherwise</h3>
A conditional test that evaluates the conditions one at a time, choosing the one that ends up being true.

<h3>templates</h3>
A top level indication that a file contains only templates/data definitions, and isn't intended to be directly used.

<h2>Request Contexts/Types</h2>
<p>This package is called multi-template because it contains methods to instantiate the templates in a few
different modes.  The three modes are server-side, js-template and js-startup.  </p>

<p>The server-side render provides
complete HTML to the client, not containing any template related JavaScript (that is, templates can define
other JavaScript, but no JavaScript will be used to render the templates themselves.)  This requires reading
all the data objects on the server side, possibly keeping a cache or information about the rendered response.</p>

<p>The js-startup mode renders a complete, single template, along with all parts of that template that have
enough information to be rendered at server side time.  It keeps track of what components are created that
depend on other templates and are marked as js-startup templates.  Anything rendered as an earlier phase
cannot be re-rendered client side as the information required to re-render it has been discarded.  
In addition to components rendered during startup, some components cannot be rendered at this time and
instead need to be post-rendered within the JavaScript client side templating library.</p>

<p>The js-template mode renders individual parts of the templating system to JavaScript, to be used to 
render one or more of the specific templates parts.  This is intended to produce compressed, cached javascript 
so as to allow the server to provide the templates extremely quickly.</p>
