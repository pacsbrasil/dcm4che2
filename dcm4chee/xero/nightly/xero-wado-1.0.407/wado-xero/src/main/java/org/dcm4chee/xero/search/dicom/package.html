  <h1>Web Service DICOM C-Find Search</h1>
  <p>This package provides a web interface to the DICOM C-Find searches.  This allows access to web clients
  of the search results without needing to create an AE for every web client, and without needing generic DICOM access 
  to the server.</p>
  
  <p>The general design is quite simple - the existing C-Find search mechanism for XML is used, except that instead
  of converting internally to an object, the result is just directly returned.  This, then uses exactly the same
  search criteria and columns that are available to the XML web study services.</p>
  
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  An example usage would be:
<pre>
http://HOSTNAME/wado2/cfind?studyUID=1.2.3&amp;level=study
