  <h1>Xero View Templates</h1>
  <p>The Xero View templates define the appearance of the Xero GUI HTML client.  The templates are written in
  a simple templating language from <a href="www.stringtemplate.org">stringtemplate</a>.  This 
  language has explicit rules about how to separate the model, view and controller components.  Specifically,
  the model should be a read-only, no side-affects (other than possibly caching and lazy looking for performance
  reasons - but the order/number of reads should be idempotent and completely equivalent to having looked
  up the model data before starting any rendering other than performance.) </p>
  
  <p>The base stringtemplate library is a Java library that includes a complete parser for the stringtemplate 
  language.  This parser is used in Java, and then a set of Stringtemplates are run on the stringtemplates
  themselves to allow generating a JavaScript implementation of the same set of templates.  Having both
  Java and JavaScript templating allows fast initial display - the templates are pre-loaded server side
  and can be used for very fast rendering.  They are then available on the client side for very fast client 
  side rendering.  In fact, with a bit of work on the controller/model components, the exact same set of 
  templates could be used offline in a static fashion.</p>
  
  <h2>Adding Templates</h2>
  <p>Templates can just be added in the src/main/resources/xero directory as required.  However, some templates
  are referenced by variable, for example in a Layout object.  These are then not included unless explicitly 
  specified.  To add such templates, add metadata that defines the template name to one of
  allTemplates, queryTemplates or displayTemplates.  For example:
<pre>
displayTemplates.myNewTemplate=image/myNewTemplate
</pre>
  is meta-data that would add image/myNewTemplate to the JavaScript view component.  </p>
  
  <h2>Adding Shared Data</h2>
  <p>Some data is used by the templates on both the client and server sides.  See the model-xero package
  for information on how to define shared data.</p>
  
  <h2>Internationalization</h2>
  <p><b>TODO</b> The expectation is that internationalization will done by adding templates in the i18n/* 
  string template group that define the text expressions required.  The English translation will be loaded
  by default, and one or more additional translations can be loaded in to extend the translation.</p>
  
  <h2>General Page Design</h2>
  <p><b>TODO</b> Document how the views are organized/arranged for the menus, study tray, study area, image area
  etc.</p>
