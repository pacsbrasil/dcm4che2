  <h1>Study Information Filters</h1>
  <p>Adds computed information about DICOM object level to the XML query/find results, or organization.
  Much of the DICOM information isn't in a format that is optimal for display, or is not available in the
  C-Find results and needs to come from one or more DICOM object headers.  This type of information is added
  to the XML study data results by the various filters in this package.  Mostly the filters work by adding
  macros of various types to the object level results - correlating results and extending information.  See
  the class summaries for information on the different filters.</p>
