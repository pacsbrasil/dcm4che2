  <h1>Xero Search Study Objects</h1>
  <p>This package defines the beans that contain study information at the patient through image(object) level, as 
  well as the search condition definitions for each level defining what fields are requested from the C-Find and
  what fields are searchable in the C-Find, including what their names are.</p>
  
  <h2>Study XML Definitions (JAXB)</h2>
  <p>The base study XML definitions are defined in the study.xsd file, which is parsed by JAXB to produce the base
  study data objects.  These are then extended with interfaces and Bean instances to add functionality to initialize
  the objects from DicomObject data, and to organize and find the children objects by id.  </p>
  
  <h2>SearchConditionParsers</h2>
  <p>The search condition parsers at the various levels use a declared tag on the study data interfaces to figure
  out what is searchable at each level, and additionally declare the search type UIDs and other required information
  to allow the search to be performed.</p>
  
  <h2>Search C-Find Filters</h2>
  <p>The Search C-Find filters are a filter that performs the C-Find itself, after getting the query criteria
  appropriate for the parameters.</p>
