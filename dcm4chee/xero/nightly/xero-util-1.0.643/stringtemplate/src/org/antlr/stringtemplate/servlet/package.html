  <h1>String Template Servlet and JavaScript Support</h1>
  <p>This package contains a simple servlet that can be configured in the web.xml to use a specific string template
  group (possibly hierarchical), and model.  Then, the JSTemplateServlet extends this to add a secondary string
  template group to be used as the model, and the jstemplate as the group.  This second servlet serves a JavaScript
  page that has a JavaScript implementation of the specied string template.   This implementation is just generated
  by running the templates in jstemplate over the string template group itself that one wants to form the model of.
  There are a few more details such as having a map of the templates to include, but basically the design is fairly
  simple.  As well, the actual templates are in JSON notation, so it is easy to add another template request that
  would extend the set of available templates - this would be useful for fast loading of the initial view followed by
  an extended load of additional views.</p>
