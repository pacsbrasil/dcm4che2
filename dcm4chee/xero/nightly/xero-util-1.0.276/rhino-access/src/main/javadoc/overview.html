<h1>Rhino Access Library</h1>
<p>The Rhino access library is intented to be used to provide easy access to and from
Rhino based JavaScript classes.  This includes access to Rhino classes as though they were
maps, simple call methods to get at Rhino methods, and various classes to allow the
general Rhino environment to look more like a browser, and to enable it to run within
a servlet environment.</p>
