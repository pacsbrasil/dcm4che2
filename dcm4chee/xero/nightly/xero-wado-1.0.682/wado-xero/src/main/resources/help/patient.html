<h2>Patient XML Service</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
C-FIND metadata service that will return a patient root hierarchy of results in
a specified text format. Constraints to the C-FIND are applied by adding
parameters that correspond to the DICOM tag names. As with any C-FIND query,
constraints on the containing types can be applied as well as the requested
level. 

<p>An empty result set will be returned if query constraints are not provided.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PatientName</td>
      <td>Constrain by patient name. By default, this is case-insensitive, and
        has some rules for searching multiple names: 

        <p>Single name given: searches only for an exact match on the last
        name</p>

        <p>Name in LastName, FirstName format: searches for the last name and
        wild cards the first name.</p>

        <p>Name in FirstName LastName format (note the missing comma to
        differentiate the types): searches for lastname, firstName with a
        wild-card.</p>

        <p>Name in DICOM format: searches only for the exact string given</p>

        <p>Name in quotes: removes the quotes and searches for the given
        string.</p>
      </td>
      <td>DICOM formatted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PatientID</td>
      <td>Constrain by the patient ID. May automatically add a prefix, suffix
        if configured, as well as automatically upper or lower caseing the
        text. 

        <p>Adds a wild-card if the patient id contains at least 4
        characters.</p>

        <p>Multiple entries can be searched for at once by separating them with
        a back-slash character (\). This requires exact-matches on the ID
        without any wild-cards. Do NOT include any wild cards in any of the
        multi-entry items as this will cause all patients to be returned.</p>
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PatientBirthDate</td>
      <td>Search on the patient's birth date.</td>
