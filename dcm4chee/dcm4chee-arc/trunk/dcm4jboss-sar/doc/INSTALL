INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE ARCHIVE:
=========================================

Minimum System Requirements
JDK 1.4.2 or higher (JDK 5 is recommended)
512 MB RAM
100 MB hard disk space (additional to archive storage disk space)  
400 MHz CPU

Supported Databases
PostgreSQL 8.1.x
MySQL 4.1+
Oracle 9i/10g
SQL Server
DB2 8.1+

For image compression/decompression, dcm4chee 2.8.x utilize Sun's Java Advanced
Imaging Image I/O Tools 1.0_01. The binary distribution packages of dcm4chee
2.8.x already includes necessary JARs and native libraries for Windows and
Linux i586. For Solaris, you have to download the SW package from Sun
[http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download-iio-1_0_01.html]
yourself and replace the Linux version of libclib_jiio.so in DCM4CHE_HOME/bin/
from the JAI Image IO package for Solaris.

Installation Procedure:

1. Extract the binary distribution package of dcm4chee for the database
of your choice. Avoid using a directory that has a name that contains spaces
as installation directory.

2. Install the Database SW - if not already done. You also have to copy an
apropriate JDBC Driver for the Database to DCM4CHEE_HOME/server/default/lib/
- except for MySQL and PostgreSQL, which binary distribution packages of
dcm4chee already contains the JDBC driver. Also ensure, that DB access via
TCP/IP socket is enabled. E.g. PostgresSQL:

$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf:
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          trust

3. Initate the archive database instance: pacsdb using create DDL script
DCM4CHEE_HOME/sql/create.xxx.

E.g.: PostgreSQL
> export PGUSER=postgres
> createdb pacsdb
> psql pacsdb -f DCM4CHEE_HOME/sql/create.psql

E.g.: MySQL
> mysql -uroot
mysql> create database pacsdb;
mysql> grant all on pacsdb.* to 'pacs'@'localhost' identified by 'pacs';
mysql> \q
> mysql -upacs -ppacs < DCM4CHEE_HOME/sql/create.mysql

4. Set environment variable JAVA_HOME to JDK location

5. Adjust maximum allocation of heap memory: 
[Windows]: DCM4CHEE_HOME/bin/run.bat:
rem Sun JVM memory allocation pool parameters. Modify as appropriate.
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms128m -Xmx512m
[Linux/Unix]: DCM4CHEE_HOME/bin/run.conf
# Specify options to pass to the Java VM.
JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms64m -Xmx200m -Djava.awt.headless=true ..

according available RAM and memory requirements of other processes on this node. 
E.g.: if only 512 MB RAM are available, you should decrease the default
value -Xmx512m on Windows to (e.g.) -Xmx300.

6. At default configuration, all DICOM services are provided with "DCM4CHEE"
as Application Entity Title. Although it is possible to change the default
configuration later on the running application using the web interface, it is
probable more efficient and reliable, to simple replace "DCM4CHEE" by
"YOUR_AET" in DCM4CHEE_HOME/server/default/conf/xmdesc/*.xml using any utility
provided by your system (e.g. Linux:

find DCM4CHEE_HOME/server/default/conf/xmdesc -exec \
           sed -i s/DCM4CHEE/YOUR_AET/g '{}' ';'
).
