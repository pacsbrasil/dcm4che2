INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE ARCHIVE:
=========================================

Minimum System Requirements
JDK 1.4.2 or higher. JDK 5 is required for upgrade of the 
  Audit Record Repository component to v3.0-SNAPSHOT
512 MB RAM
100 MB hard disk space (additional to archive storage disk space)  
400 MHz CPU

Supported Databases
PostgreSQL 8.1.x
MySQL 4.1+
Oracle 9i/10g
SQL Server
DB2 8.1+

For image compression/decompression, dcm4chee 2.8.x utilize Sun's Java Advanced
Imaging Image I/O Tools 1.0_01. The binary distribution packages of dcm4chee
2.8.x already includes necessary JARs and native libraries for Windows and
Linux i586. For Solaris, you have to download the SW package from Sun
[http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download-iio-1_0_01.html]
yourself and replace the Linux version of libclib_jiio.so in DCM4CHEE_DIST/bin/
from the JAI Image IO package for Solaris.

Installation Procedure:

1. Extract the binary distribution package of dcm4chee for the database
of your choice. Avoid using a directory that has a name that contains spaces
as installation directory.

2. Install the Database SW - if not already done. You also have to copy an
apropriate JDBC Driver for the Database to DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/lib/
- except for MySQL and PostgreSQL, which binary distribution packages of
dcm4chee already contains a JDBC driver. Also ensure, that DB access via
TCP/IP socket is enabled. E.g. PostgresSQL:

$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf:
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          trust

3. Initiate the archive database instance: pacsdb using create DDL script
DCM4CHEE_DIST/sql/create.xxx.

E.g.: PostgreSQL
> export PGUSER=postgres
> createdb pacsdb
> psql pacsdb -f DCM4CHEE_DIST/sql/create.psql

E.g.: MySQL
> mysql -uroot
mysql> create database pacsdb;
mysql> grant all on pacsdb.* to 'pacs'@'localhost' identified by 'pacs';
mysql> \q
> mysql -upacs -ppacs < DCM4CHEE_DIST/sql/create.mysql

4. Adjust the Database connection configuration (host, port, DB name, user
password) of the archive:

DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/deploy/xxxx-ds.xml

according your Database configuration. 

5. Set environment variable JAVA_HOME to JDK location.

6. Adjust maximum allocation of heap memory: 
[Windows]: DCM4CHEE_DIST/bin/run.bat:
rem Sun JVM memory allocation pool parameters. Modify as appropriate.
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms128m -Xmx512m
[Linux/Unix]: DCM4CHEE_DIST/bin/run.conf
# Specify options to pass to the Java VM.
JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms64m -Xmx200m -Djava.awt.headless=true ..

according available RAM and memory requirements of other processes on this node. 
E.g.: if only 512 MB RAM are available, you should decrease the default
value -Xmx512m on Windows to (e.g.) -Xmx300.

7. [Optional] At default configuration, all DICOM services are provided with
"DCM4CHEE" as Application Entity Title. Although it is possible to change the
default configuration later on the running application using the web interface,
it is more efficient and reliable, to replace "DCM4CHEE" by "YOUR_AET" in
DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/conf/xmdesc/*.xml using any utility provided by
your platform. E.g. GNU Linux:

> find DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/conf/xmdesc -exec \
           sed -i s/DCM4CHEE_DIST/YOUR_AET/g '{}' ';'
           

8. To test your installation, move to the DCM4CHEE_DIST/bin directory and 
execute the run.bat or run.sh script, as appropriate for your operating system.
Your output should look like the following and contain no error or exception 
messages:

9. Connect to the Web Interface at http://localhost:8080/dcm4chee-web/
of the archive using any Web Browser (most tested are Mozilla-Firefox and
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.x). You should get the User Login Screen.
Login in using default Administrator account 'admin', with password 'admin'.

10. Connect to JBoss's JMX Console at http://localhost:8080/jmx-console/ and
login using also the Administrator account 'admin', with password 'admin'.

Follow the link "service=FileSystemMgt" to the configuration page for 
File System Management service under the "dcm4chee.archive" heading.

Invoke the operation addOnlineFileSystem(), with argument dirPath specifying
the directory, where the archive shall store received objects/images.

(If no Storage File System is configured, the archive will auto-configure
DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/archive as Storage File System, when receiving
the first object/image)

11. [Optional] At default configuration, received images are stored as received
- in particular, no compression is performed. Lossless compression of received
uncompressed images can be activated by attribute "CompressionRules" in the
configuration page for the Storage SCP Service (service=StoreScp). E.g. set it
to "JLSL", to compress all type of images received from any Storage SCU using
JPEG-LS Lossless codec.

12. [Optional] The directory used for caching generated JPEG representations
of archived images requested by Web Access to DICOM Persistent Objects (WADO)
can be specified by attribute "CacheRoot" in the configuration page for
the WADO Service (service=WADOService). 
Default: DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/wadocache.

The directory used for caching generated PDF representations of archived
Structured Report Documents requested by IHE Retrieve Information for Display
(RID) Services can be specified by attribute "CacheRoot" in the configuration
page for the RID Service (service=RIDService). 
Default: DCM4CHEE_DIST/server/default/ihe_rid_cache.

13. Send some object/images to the archive's Storage SCP, e.g. by using the 
send utility of the dcm4che 2.0 core package available at Sourceforge
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che). E.g:

> dcm4che-2.0.6/bin/dcmsnd DCM4CHEE@localhost:11112 ~/mesa/storage/modality/MR

Refresh the Web Interface (http://localhost:8080/dcm4chee-web/), which shall 
now show the the list of received studies.

Expand one study row to show contained series. Expand one of these series
to show contained instances. In the case of images, you can follow the image
icon on the right, to invoke a http WADO request for a JPEG presentation of
this image, which will be displayed in a separate browser window.

14. To test object retrieval, you need an external Storage SCP acting as
Move Destination, e.g. by using the receiver utility of the dcm4che 2.0 core:

> dcm4che-2.0.6/bin/dcmrcv 11113
13:55:14,782 INFO   - Start listening on 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:11113
Start Server listening on port 11113

You also need to configure an additional Application Entity Title identifying
this Move Destination using "AE Management" function of the Web Interface.
E.g. new AET
AE Title: DCMRCV
Hostname: localhost
Port:     11113

Switch back to the Study List ("Folder"), mark studies to retrieve using the
check box on the right, select "DCMRCV" as send destination in the combo box
above and click on the send button left from it.

15. If that works, you may stop the archive by Ctrl+C in the console you have
started it, and 
[Windows]: install it as Windows service executing install_service.bat
or 
[Redhat Linux]: copy the init script dcm4chee_init_redhat.sh to /etc/init.d/
and adjust it according your installation location of the archive and the JDK
and under which user the archive application shall run.

UPGRADE TO AUDIT RECORD REPOSITORY v3.0-SNAPSHOT:
================================================
WARNING: Audit Record Repository v3.0-SNAPSHOT is only provided as an early
technical preview. It's NOT SUITABLE for use in production! 

Audit Record Repository v3.0-SNAPSHOT requires JDK 5. Java 1.4.2 is NOT
sufficient!

Upgrade Procedure:

1. Extract the binary distribution package for the upgrade of the Audit Record
Repository (upgrade-dcm4chee-arr-<DB>-<vers>.zip) in the installation
directory of dcm4chee.

2. Move to the DCM4CHEE_DIST/bin directory and execute the
uninstall-dcm4chee-arr-old.bat or uninstall-dcm4chee-arr-old.sh script.

You will find a DDL script for extending the DB schema with tables used by
dcm4chee-arr-3.0-SNAPSHOT at DCM4CHEE_DIST/sql/dcm4chee-arr-DB_NAME.dll. You
do NOT need to execute that manually. Needed tables will be automatical created
at first startup of the application with deployed dcm4chee-arr-3.0-SNAPSHOT.
