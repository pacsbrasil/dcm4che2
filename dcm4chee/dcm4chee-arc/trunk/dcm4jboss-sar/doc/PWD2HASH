UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR HASHED PASSWORDS:
========================================

The login module has been changed to store the (readable) password as hash values for security reasons.
(see: options "hashEncoding","hashCharset" and "hashAlgorithm" in login-config.xml.

In order to keep be able to login (jmx-console, dcm4chee-web, twiddle), 
you have to update the password column to <hashed password> values!
(BASE64 encoded SHA hash).

To get the <hashed password> for a <readable password> you can use the pwd2hash utility in <DCM4CHEE_HOME>/bin:

	java -jar pwd2hash.jar <readable password>

To change password column:
	Open pacsdb with your database client tool and perform following SQL statement:

	UPDATE users SET passwd='<hashed password>' WHERE passwd='<readable password>';

The hash values for the two initial passwords are:

	admin:0DPiKuNIrrVmD8IUCuw1hQxNqZc=

	user:Et6pb+wgWTVmq3VpLJlJWWgzrck=

e.g. To change password admin:
	UPDATE users SET passwd='0DPiKuNIrrVmD8IUCuw1hQxNqZc=' WHERE passwd='admin';
