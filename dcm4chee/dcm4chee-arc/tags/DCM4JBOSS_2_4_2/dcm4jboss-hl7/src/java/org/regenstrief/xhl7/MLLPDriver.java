/** HL7 MLLP Driver manages a pair of Input/Output Streams according to
              the HL7 Minimal Lower Layer Protocol.

  <p>
  The MLLP protocol is a half-duplex protocol, which means that the 
  driver must maintain a state and act differently depending on the 
  state. A driver is initially in state clear-to-send if it will be
  sending first. When in clear-to-send, something must be sent before
  one can begin receiving. When the driver is in sending state, the
  first reading call will terminate sending and begin receiving. Once
  in receiving mode, all output is buffered in a growing buffer that
  is only flushed to the stream when the peer has terminated sending.
