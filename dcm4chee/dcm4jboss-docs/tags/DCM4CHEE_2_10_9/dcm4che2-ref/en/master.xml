            dcm4che is a high performance, open source implementation of the DICOM standard.  It is developed in the Java 
            programming language.  Version 2.x of this toolkit (which is what this document covers) is the next generation of 
            the popular dcm4che14 version.  The toolkit has undergone a re-architecting with an improvement over the 1.x 
            versions with regards to speed, memory usage, and a more robust DICOM dictionary implementation.

        <para>
            The best way to get started with the toolkit is to use, and examine the code of, the sample applications documented 
            in <xref linkend="dcm4che-utilities"/>.  These are full featured applications that are able to be used in a stand-along
            fashion, and demonstrate the capabilities of the toolkit.

            The dcm4che toolkit implements the <ulink url="http://medical.nema.org/">DICOM 2006 standard</ulink>.  As such, 
            it is beneficial to the user that they have a good understanding of that standard.
