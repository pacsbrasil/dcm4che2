<h1>Xero Search Package</h1>

<p>The Xero Search package provides a framework for responding to search requests for study, series and image data.
The base package includes components to generate search criteria, lists of columsn to return, and to perform
DICOM C-Find searches.  The {@see org.dcm4chee.xero.search.study} sub-package contains extensions for the specific
patient/study/series/image objects.</p>

<p>The functionality within this package is relatively self-explanatory based on the class summaries.</p>
