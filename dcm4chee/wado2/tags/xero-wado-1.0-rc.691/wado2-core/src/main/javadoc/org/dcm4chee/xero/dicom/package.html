<h2>XERO DICOM Utilities Package</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
The org.dcm4chee.xero.dicom package contains utility classes that are used with the 
DCM4CHE DICOM libraries.  

<h3>Design</h3>
The package is broken into three types of utility:  DICOM helper classes, General utilities
and Network AE handlers.  The classes in this module have been pulled in from the CFIND module
to consolidate the DICOM handling into one easy to find place.

<h3>Contents</h3>
<h4>DICOM AE Utilities</h4>
<dl>
<dt>AEConnection</dt>
<dd>
Network AE configuration class.  Loads AE / machine settings from properties files in 
the server classpath.
</dd>

<dt>AESettings</dt>
<dd>
Legacy AE configuration accessor.  Writes AE settings into local variables.  Has been
replaced by the ApplicationEntityProvider class for new code.
</dd>

<dt>ApplicationEntityProvider</dt>
<dd>
Factory class that generates DCM4CE NetworkApplicationEntity instances based on
the AE configuration properties files.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>DICOM Manipulation Tools</h4>
<dl>
<dt>DicomCommandChecker</dt>
<dd>
DICOM command status code checking utility.  Will identify successful and pending operations
and automatically throw DicomException when problems are encountered.
</dd>

<dt>DicomException</dt>
<dd>
Basic exception for indicating a DICOM based exception to the system.  The IOException is
extended to allow for it to be transparently thrown from URL methods.
</dd>

<dt>DicomDateTimeHandler</dt>
<dd>
Utility that handles concatenation, parsing and formating of DICOM date, time and datetime
fields.  This class was extracted from the date / time handling that was introduced as a 
part of the IMPAX spftp integration.
</dd>

<dt>DicomElementAccessor</dt>
<dd>
Lightweight metadata access proxy that encapsulates whether the full header or the C-FIND
response is used to return a particular DICOM element. 
</dd>

<dt>DicomURLHandler</dt>
<dd>The DICOM C-MOVE code uses a DICOM URL syntax to specify resources:  <code>dicom://ae@host:port/query</code>
This class will generate properly formatted URLs and associate them with a URL handler 
that can retrieve the data when the URLConnection.openStream() call is invoked.
</dd>

<dt>SOPClassUIDs</dt>
<dd>
Static class that contains useful Lists of SOP Instance UIDs.  The content of 
this file has been centralized here from various DICOM sources in the codebase.
</dd>

<dt>TransferSyntaxCapabilitySelector</dt>
<dd>
The logic for choosing the best transfer syntax for a DICOM association based
on the transfer capabilities of the SCP and SCU.
</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Miscellaneous Utilities</h4>
<dl>
<dt>FilesystemWatcher</dt>
<dd>
Utility class that can watch for a file to be created at a particular file
path and return a stream to it when it is available.  This class is a bit 
out of place in the *.dicom package, and might move to a general utility
package in the future.
