<h2>XERO C-MOVE File Access Package</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
The org.dcm4chee.xero.wado.cmove package contains the classes that integrate the 
C-MOVE into the URL based file retrieval logic of XERO. 

<h3>Design</h3>
C-MOVE support is integrated into the XERO WADO services through the Filter<URL> interface.
File requests are translated into DICOM formatted URLS (<code>dicom://ae@host:port/query</code>)
and passed through the filter pipeline to endpoints that need files (images).

<p>

The DICOM URL syntax is currently hardcoded to use C-MOVE for file transfer, but could be 
extended in future to handle other C-MOVE retrieval strategies or even C-GET syntax.  The 
URL syntax is designed to be close to both the WADO URL syntax and the Agility DICOM URI format.


<h3>Contents</h3>
<dl>
<dt>CMoveSettings</dt>
<dd>
Accessor class that provides easy access to C-MOVE specific properties in the AE configuration file
</dd>

<dt>CMoveURLConnection</dt>
<dd>
Implementation of the URLConnection class that coordinates the creation of a C-MOVE request,
and the file system monitoring in the retrieval cache.
</dd>

<dt>DicomURLStreamHandler</dt>
<dd>
Integrates the C-MOVE logic with the Java URL connection framework.  The logic in this class
is pretty basic at the moment, but the idea is that external configuration will be applied at this level
in the future.
</dd>

<dt>FileLocationCMoveFilter</dt>
<dd>
Integrates the DICOM C-MOVE URL code with the file location filters in XERO.  The 
servlet arguments are processed into a DICOM URL which is associated with the 
DicomURLStreamHandler.  This allows filters downstream to access an input stream 
that is fed by C-MOVE transparently.
