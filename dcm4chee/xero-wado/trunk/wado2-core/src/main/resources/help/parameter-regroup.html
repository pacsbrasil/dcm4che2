<h2>Query Parameter: regroup</h2>
The 'regroup' flag is used to determine if the series will be grouped/sorted  by the server before the metadata is returned to the client.  
By default the flag is turned on, and to turn it off the following expression should be added to the URL query string:  'regroup=false'.
<p>
To request a study without regrouping the series the following request should be used:
<br>
http://host/wado2/?requestType=IMAGE&ampAccessionNumber=1234&ampregroup=false
<p>
NOTE:  Activating regrouping of images can require the retrieval of the full DICOM header for
objects being processed.  This can lead to performance degradation for studies will a large 
number of images.

<h3>Regrouping of MG Studies</h3>
MG regrouping is done based on the laterality and orientation of each image found in the study.
The laterality and orientation are determined from the Image Laterality and View Code Sequence 
DICOM elements.
<p>
The following steps will be performance in the grouping of MG images:
<ul>
<li>Images that are not oriented left in the anterior view will be flipped to this orientation.  
<li>Standardized series descriptions will be generated i.e. "L CC" or "R MLO"
<li>Images will be grouped into the appropriate series
<li>Series will sorted so that CC images are always after MLO.
</ul>

<h3>Regrouping of Multiframe Studies</h3>
Multiframe studies are regrouped by the Instance Number element of the DICOM header.  This will 
generally result in the separation of multiframes into separate series.

<h3>Regrouping of MR Studies</h3>
Not yet implemented due to a lack of suitable DICOM data.
