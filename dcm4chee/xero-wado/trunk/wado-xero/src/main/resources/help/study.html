<h2>Study XML Service</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
C-FIND metadata service that will return a patient root hierarchy of results in
a specified text format. Constraints to the C-FIND are applied by adding
parameters that correspond to the DICOM tag names. As with any C-FIND query,
constraints on the containing types can be applied as well as the requested
level. 

<p>An empty result set will be returned if query constraints are not provided.
</p>

<p>See <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> level information for included query
constraints/results at the patient level.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ko</td>
      <td>Set to * to include in the study information the preferred key images
        instance to apply. It is fairly slow in general to look this up, so
        only use for a particular patient's studies or for some other fairly
        constrained study list.</td>
      <td>Causes koUID to be returned if available.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gsps</td>
      <td>Set to * to include the preferred GSPS (markup/annotations) to be
        determined per-study. Fairly slow, so only use it for a small number of
        studies being returned (eg all studies for a single patient).</td>
      <td>Causes gspsLabel to be returned if available.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AccessionNumber</td>
      <td>Constrain by the accession number of the study. Multiple values
        separated by \ are permitted.</td>
      <td>Returned in XML</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>studyUID</td>
      <td>Constrain by the UID of the study. Multiple entries can be searched

      <td>Returned in XML</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ModalitiesInStudy</td>
      <td>Constrain by the modalities in the study. Multiple entries can be
        searched for by separating them with the backslash \ character.</td>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>StudyID</td>
      <td>Search by the Study ID. This is another, typically internal ID for
        studies.</td>

      <td>StudyStatusID</td>
      <td>For some PACS systems, studies are searchable by the study status.
        Impax Data Center is not one of the systems searchable in this
      fashion.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>NumberOfStudyRelatedSeries</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NumberOfStudyRelatedInstances</td>
      <td>Contains the number of DICOM objects this study contains. This will

        not be that good an indicator.</td>
