<h2>Study XML Service</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
C-FIND metadata service that will return a patient root hierarchy of results in
a specified text format. Constraints to the C-FIND are applied by adding
parameters that correspond to the DICOM tag names. As with any C-FIND query,
constraints on the containing types can be applied as well as the requested
level. 

<p>An empty result set will be returned if query constraints are not provided.
</p>

<p>See <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> level information for included query
constraints/results at the patient level.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AccessionNumber</td>
      <td>Constrain by the accession number of the study. Multiple values
        separated by \ are permitted.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>studyUID</td>
      <td>Constrain by the UID of the study. Multiple entries can be searched
        for by separating them with the backslash \ character.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ModalitiesInStudy</td>
      <td>Constrain by the modalities in the study. Multiple entries can be
        searched for by separating them with the backslash \ character.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>StudyDescription</td>
      <td>Constrain by the study description</td>
      <td>Allows wildcards</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>StudyDateTime</td>
      <td>Search by the study date-time.</td>
      <td>See <a href="COMMON.html">Common</a> for format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>StudyID</td>
      <td>Search by the Study ID. This is another, typically internal ID for
        studies.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ReferringPhysicianName</td>
      <td>Search by referring physician.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>StudyStatusID</td>
      <td>For some PACS systems, studies are searchable by the study status.
        Impax Data Center is not one of the systems searchable in this
      fashion.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>InstanceAvailability</td>
      <td>Determines how fast it is to access the given study. ONLINE means the
        study is easily accessed, NEARLINE means a slight delay and OFFLINE
        means someone needs to manually mount a tape which could take hours to
        days.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NumberOfStudyRelatedSeries</td>
      <td>Contains the number of sets of images (series) that this study
        contains. A series is typically a set of related images all taken at

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NumberOfStudyRelatedInstances</td>
      <td>Contains the number of DICOM objects this study contains. This will
        typically be an indicator of study size, but for multi-frames it may
        not be that good an indicator.</td>
