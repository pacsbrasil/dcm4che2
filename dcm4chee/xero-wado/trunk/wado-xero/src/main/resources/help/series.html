<h2>Series Metadata Service</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
C-FIND metadata service that will return a patient root hierarchy of results in
a specified text format. Constraints to the C-FIND are applied by adding
parameters that correspond to the DICOM tag names. As with any C-FIND query,
constraints on the containing types can be applied as well as the requested
level. 

<p>An empty result set will be returned if query constraints are not provided.

        included at the series level instead.</td>
