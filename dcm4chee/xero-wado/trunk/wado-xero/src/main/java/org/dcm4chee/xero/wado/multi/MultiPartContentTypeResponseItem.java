/**
 *  This class stores an array of object UID's and uses a set of filters to determine what responses to encode.
 *  
 *  The filters are called once for every requested object, with some of them being called for every frame of every requested
 *  object.  This does require some intimate knowledge of the details of the DICOM objects being returned.
 *  
 *  In general, all the headers are passed to the child objects, except the ones explicitly listed in the child filter's meta-data
 *  to exclude or replace (exclude is done by specifying "_exclude" as the parameter value.)  Filter that return "null" will 
 *  write no data, otherwise an error will be written as a mime element, and the rest of the items will continue to be written.
 *  
 *  This class is fairly tightly bound with MultiPartContentTypeFilter, with most of the non-multipart logic being contained in that
 *  filter rather than here.  This design allows other types of multi-part responses to be created in the future such as ZIP encoded files.
