  <h1>MetaData Pipe-Filter to Servlet Response</h1>
  <p>The MetaData pipe-filter to servlet mechanism allows a single servlet class to have pluggable/extendible values
  that use a pipe & filter mechanism.  You might wonder why straight Servlet FilterChains aren't used, but such chains
  are highly servlet specific and only allow passing of data as servlet parameters, and returning of data as streams.
  This makes it inconvenient for image manipulation frameworks as a significant amount of the total work is just in 
  moving data around, and being able to pass/return images directly is of signicant benefit.  This is also true to
  a lesser degree for generating/returning XML and other types of streams.  Finally, other uses can be made of the 
  same caches used for the servlets if other types of responses are required.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Basic design</h2>
  <p>The basic design of the meta-data servlet is a servlet that has a pluggable Filter that returns a 
  ServletRequestItem.  That servlet request item knows how to render the final page/response for the servlet, but
  the filter stage itself should do most or all of the initial lookup of the data for the servlet response item.  
  This design allows most filters to just return whatever data type they need, but still allows a customization of
  the overall return type and/or error returns if required, as well as using more information about the actual response
  or setting information such as expiry and content encoding in the response types.</p>
  
  <h2>Basic MetaDataServlet Configuration</h2>
  <p>{@see MetaDataServlet} for details on how to declare a meta-data servlet.</p>
  
  <h2>Support For MetaData Servlets</h2>
  <p>Some existing classes exist in both this package and in xero-util that support meta-data servlet responses - 
  {@see JaxbFilter} in this package and StringTemplateFilter in the util-xero template package.</p>
