  <h1>Pipe And Filter Framework Based on Xero MetaData</h1>
  <p>This package contains a pipe and filter framework designed to allow servlets to use a variety of filter components
  to generate the overall servlet response.  It is possible to use the filter for other mechanisms, as it isn't at all
  tied to the servlet framework, but is a fully general framework.</p>
