BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE Modality Worklist Replication Service:
======================================================================

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running DCM4CHEE
you also have to download and install Maven 2.0.7 from
http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building the MWL Replica Service.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

You also need to install dcm4chee-sar and dcm4chee-ejb-client jars from DCM4CHEE (2.13.5) to your local maven repository:
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=dcm4che -DartifactId=dcm4chee-sar -Dversion=2.13.5 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<DCM4CHEE>/server/default/lib/dcm4chee.jar 
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=dcm4che -DartifactId=dcm4chee-ejb-client -Dversion=2.13.5 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<DCM4CHEE>/server/default/lib/dcm4chee-ejb-client.jar

$ cd dcm4chee-mwl-replica
$ mvn install

(will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
before building MBean )

The resulting sar file in dcm4chee-mwl-replica-mbean/target can be deployed by copying to <DCM4CHEE>/server/default/deploy.
